## Information

OpenSignal is a cross platform, written from scratch, unified library for AI/Neural Network Development, Signal Processing, Image Processing, Audio Processing and Hardware IO Operations, All in one, with just as a shared library format.

Project is developed using C Language, but I've tried to write it as clean and readable as possible. I've trying to achieve this goal as designing functions modular basis. With modular design, I've aiming high code reusability, easy debugging and tracing, and lower code redundancy.
