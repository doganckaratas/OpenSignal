## Information

OpenSignal is a unified library for AI/Neural Network Development, Signal Processing, Image Processing, Audio Processing and Hardware IO Operations, All in one, with just as a shared library format.

Project is developed using C Language, but I've tried to write it as clean and readable as I can. So, the codebase syntax resembles (kinda) object oriented pattern (although it is still C).
